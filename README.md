Brief explanation of what the app is and does
Link to live site
Discussion of technologies used
Delve deep into ~2 features that show off your technical abilities. Discuss both the challenges faced and your brilliant solutions.
Code snippets to highlight your best code (markdown code snippets, NOT screenshots)

Do not list out every single feature on your app.
No screenshots; only screen clippings. i.e. Don't show your entire browser window and several other open tabs.
Don't refer to your app as your 'App Academy Full-Stack Project'. Present it as a professional site.
Don't wax on about the features that you didn't have time to implement. Simply list them at the bottom of the readme as future directions for the project.
